About
=====

The Yade Technical Archive (YTA) seeks to improve the reproducibility of Yade related publications by clarifying the theory that underlies `Yade's opensource code <https://github.com/yade>`__, explaining algorithmic implementations, and providing practical tutorials. In doing so, YTA removes the opacity that commonly exists between readers and computational journal articles, strengthens and improves visibility of existing Yade journal papers, enables academic collaborations, and broadens open access academia.

Contribute
==========

YTA seeks a variety of Yade related materials including, but not limited to:
	- theoretical descriptions of code packages
	- user guides and tutorials for code packages
	- presentations 
	- course materials
	- supplementary materials for journal articles


Contact
=======
If you wish to contribute, please contact the `YTA maintainer <rob.caulk@gmail.com>`__. Questions about individual publications are referred to the email address attached to the document description. If you have general questions regarding code, we refer you to `our Q&A forum <https://answers.launchpad.net/yade>`__.
