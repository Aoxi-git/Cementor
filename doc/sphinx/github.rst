Yade on GitLab
##############

************************************************
Fast checkout without GitLab account (read-only)
************************************************
 
Getting the source code without registering on GitLab can be done via a single command. It will not allow interactions with the remote repository, which you access the read-only way::

 git clone https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk.git

************************
Using branches on GitLab
************************

Most usefull commands are below. For more details, see for instance http://gitref.org/index.html and https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

Setup
=====

1. Register on gitlab.com

2. Add your `SSH key <https://gitlab.com/profile/keys>`_ to GitLab:

3. Set your username and email through terminal:

 ::

  git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
  git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
  
 You can check these settings with ``git config --list``.
  

4. `Fork a repo <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_:

 Click the “Fork” button on the https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk

5. Set Up Your Local Repo through terminal:

 ::

  git clone git@gitlab.com:username/trunk.git

 This creates a new folder, named trunk, that contains the whole code (make sure username is replaced by your GitLab name).

6. Configure remotes (optional)

 ::

  cd to/newly/created/folder
  git remote add upstream git@gitlab.com:yade-dev/trunk.git
  git remote update

 Now, your "trunk" folder is linked with two remote repositories both hosted on gitlab.com, the original trunk from yade-dev (called "upstream" after the last command) and the fork which resides in your personal account (called "origin" and always configured by default). Through appropriate commands explained below, you will be able to update your code to include changes commited by others, or to commit yourself changes that others can get.

Retrieving older Commits
========================

In case you want to work with, or compile, an older version of Yade which is not tagged, you can create your own (local) branch of the corresponding daily build. Look `here <https://answers.launchpad.net/yade/+question/235867>`_ for details.

Committing and updating 
========================

For those used to other version control systems, note that the commit mechanisms in Git significantly differs from that of `Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ or `SVN <https://subversion.apache.org/>`_. Therefore, don't expect to find a one-to-one command replacement. In some cases, however, the equivalent bazaar command is indicated below to ease the transition.

Inspecting changes
------------------

You may start by inspecting your changes with a few commands. For the "diff" command, it is convenient to copy from the output of "status" instead of typing the path to modified files. ::

 git status
 git diff path/to/modified/file.cpp

Committing changes
------------------

Then you proceed to commit through terminal::

 git add path/to/new/file.cpp  #Version a newly created file: equivalent of "bzr add"
 git commit path/to/new_or_modified/file.cpp -m'Commit message'``  #Validate a change. It can be done several times after every sufficient change. No equivalent in bzr, it's like commiting to your own local repository
 git push  #Push your changes into GitLab. Equivalent of "bzr commit", except that your are commiting to your own remote branch

Changes will be pushed to your personal "fork", If you have tested your changes and you are ready to push them into the main trunk, just do a "pull request" from your fork to yade-dev repo (see gitlab website for help) or create a patch from your commit via::

 git format-patch origin  #create patch file in current folder)

and send to the developers mailing list (yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net) as attachment. In either way, after reviewing your changes they will be added to the main trunk.

When the pull request has been reviewed and accepted, your changes are integrated in the main trunk. Everyone will get them via ``git fetch``.

Updating
--------

You may want to get changes done by others::

 git fetch upstream  #Pull new updates from the upstream to your branch. Eq. of "bzr update", updating the remote branch from the upstream yade/trunk
 git merge upstream/master  #Merge upstream changes into your master-branch (eq. of "bzr update", updating your local repository from the remote branch)

Alternatively, this will do fetch+merge all at once (discouraged if you have uncommited changes)::

 git pull

**********************************************************************************************
Working directly on git/trunk (not possible after GitLab migration - section will get updates)
**********************************************************************************************

This direct access to trunk will sound more familiar to `bzr <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ or `svn <https://subversion.apache.org/>`_ users. It is only possible for members of the git team "developpers". Send an email at yade-dev@lists.launchpad.net to join this team (don't forget to tell your git account name).

* Get trunk:

 ::

  git clone git@gitlab.com:yade-dev/trunk.git

 This creates a new folder, named trunk, that contains the whole code.

* Update

 ::

  git pull

* Commit to local repository

 ::

  git commit filename1 filename2 ...

* Push changes to remote trunk

 ::

  git push

 Now, the changes you made are included in the on-line code, and can be get back by every user.

To avoid confusing logs after each commit/pull/push cycle, it is better to setup automatic rebase::

 git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always

Now your file ~/.gitconfig should include::

	  [branch]
	    autosetuprebase = always

Check also .git/config file in your local trunk folder (rebase = true)::

	  [remote "origin"]
	    url = git@gitlab.com:yade-dev/trunk.git
	    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	  [branch "master"]
	    remote = origin
	    merge = refs/heads/master
	    rebase = true

Auto-rebase may have unpleasant side effects by blocking "pull" if you have uncommited changes. In this case you can use "git stash"::

 git pull
 lib/SConscript: needs update
 refusing to pull with rebase: your working tree is not up-to-date
 git stash #hide the uncommited changes away
 git pull  #now it's ok
 git push  #push the commited changes
 git stash pop #get uncommited changes back

********************************************
General guidelines for pushing to yade/trunk
********************************************

1. Set autorebase globaly on the computer (only once see above), or at least on current local branch. Non-rebased pull requests will not be accepted on the upstream. This is to keep history linear, and avoid the merge commits.  

2. Inspect the diff to make sure you will not commit junk code (typically some "cout<<" left here and there), using in terminal:

 ::

  git diff file1
  
 Or using your preferred difftool, such as kdiff3:
  
 ::
  
  git difftool -t kdiff3 file1

 Or, alternatively, any GUI for git: gitg, git-cola... 

3. Commit selectively:

 ::

  git commit file1 file2 file3 -m "message" # is good
  git commit -a -m "message"                # is bad. It is the best way to commit things that should not be commited

4. Be sure to work with an up-to-date version launching:

 ::

  git pull

5. Make sure it compiles and that regression tests pass: try ``yade --test`` and ``yade --check``.

6. You can finally let all Yade-users enjoy your work:

 ::

  git push


**Thanks a lot for your cooperation to Yade!**
