***************************
High precision calculations
***************************

Yade supports high precision and arbitrary precision ``Real`` type for performing calculations. All tests and checks pass but still the current support is considered experimental.
The backend library is `boost <https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision>`__ `multiprecision <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html>`__
along with corresponding `boost <https://github.com/boostorg/math>`__ `math toolkit <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/math/doc/html/index.html>`__.

The supported types are following:

=============================================== =============== =============================== ==================================================================
type						bits		decimal places			notes
=============================================== =============== =============================== ==================================================================
``float``					``32``		``6``				hardware accelerated (not useful, it is only for testing purposes)
``double``					``64``		``15``				hardware accelerated
``long double``					``80``		``18``				hardware accelerated
``boost::multiprecision::float128``		``128``		``33``				depending on processor type it may be hardware accelerated, `wrapped by boost <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/float128.html>`__
``boost::multiprecision::mpfr``			``Nbit``	``Nbit/(log(2)/log(10))``	uses external mpfr library, `wrapped by boost <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/mpfr_float.html>`__
``boost::multiprecision::cpp_bin_float``	``Nbit``	``Nbit/(log(2)/log(10))``	uses boost only, but is slower
=============================================== =============== =============================== ==================================================================

The last two types are arbitrary precision, and their number of bits ``Nbit`` or decimal places is specified as argument during compilation.

Installation
===========================================

The precompiled yade package uses ``double`` type by default. In order to use high precision type yade has to be compiled and installed from source code by following the
regular :ref:`installation instructions <install-from-source-code>`. With extra following caveats:

1. Additional packages are required to be installed: ``python-mpmath`` ``libmpfr-dev`` ``libmpfrc++-dev`` (the ``mpfr`` related
   packages are necessary only to use ``boost::multiprecision::mpfr`` type).

2. The debian/ubuntu package ``python-minieigen`` must be of version 0.50.4 or higher. This package hasn't been prepared yet, hence currently following solutions are possible:

	1. Patch the older ``python-minieigen`` debian package with `these patches <https://gitlab.com/cosurgi/minieigen-real/tree/master/patches>`__, the patches already included in the debian package are also required.
	2. Or copy `the patched minieigen files <https://gitlab.com/cosurgi/minieigen-real/tree/master/minieigen-local>`__ into local directory and pass the extra cmake argument ``MINIEIGEN_INCLUDE_PATH=…``, relative to this path the sources should reside inside ``minieigen`` subdirectory. The path ``/usr/include/minieigen`` is used by default to find the minieigen sources.

3. A g++ compiler version 9.2.1 or higher is required. It shall be noted that upgrading only the compiler on an existing linux installation is difficult and it is not recommended. A simpler solution is to upgrade entire linux installation.

4. During cmake invocation specify:

	1. either number of bits as ``REAL_PRECISION_BITS=……``
	2. or number of requested decimal places as ``REAL_DECIMAL_PLACES=……``, but not both
	3. to use MPFR specify ``ENABLE_MPFR=ON``.

   The arbitrary precision (``mpfr`` or ``cpp_bin_float``) types are used only when more than 128 bits or more than 39 decimal places are requested. In such case if ``ENABLE_MPFR=OFF`` then
   the slower ``cpp_bin_float`` type is used. The difference in decimal places between 39 and 33 stems from the fact that `15 bits are used for exponent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format>`__.

.. FIXME : MINIEIGEN_PATH is not used by cmake currently

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#supp1] This feature is supported natively, which means that specific numerical traits were written :ysrc:`for Eigen <lib/high-precision/EigenNumTraits.hpp>` and :ysrc:`for CGAL <lib/high-precision/CgalNumTraits.hpp>`, as well as :ysrc:`specific GUI <gui/qt5/SerializableEditor.py>` and :ysrc:`python support <lib/high-precision/ToFromPythonConverter.hpp>` were added.

.. [#supp2] The module was tested, the ``yade --test`` and ``yade --check`` pass, as well as most of examples are working. But it hasn't been tested extensively for all possible use cases.

.. [#supp3] Supported via :ysrc:`compatibility layer <lib/compatibility/VTKCompatibility.hpp>` which converts all numbers down to ``double`` type. See :ref:`below <vtkRealCompatibility>`.

.. [#supp4] The module is enabled by default, the ``yade --test`` and ``yade --check`` pass, as well as most of examples are working. However the calculations are performed at lower ``double`` precision. A wrapper/converter layer for :ysrc:`LAPACK library <lib/compatibility/LapackCompatibility.hpp>` has been implemented. To make it work with full precision these routines should be reimplemented using Eigen.

.. [#supp5] Experimentally supported for ``long double`` and ``float128``. Not supported for ``mpfr`` and ``cpp_bin_float``. File :ysrc:`lib/base/openmp-accu.hpp` needs further testing. If in doubt, compile yade with ``ENABLE_OPENMP=OFF``.

.. [#supp6] MPI support has not been tested and sending data over network hasn't been tested yet.

.. [#supp7] Not supported, the code uses external cholmod library which supports only ``double`` type. To make it work a native Eigen solver for linear equations should be used.

.. [#supp8] Potential blocks use external library coinor for linear programming, this library uses ``double`` type only. To make it work a linear programming routine has to be implemented using Eigen, or a similar converter/wrapper can be used as for :ysrc:`LAPACK library <lib/compatibility/LapackCompatibility.hpp>`.

.. [#supp9] This feature is ``OFF`` by default, the support of this feature has not been tested.

The unsupported modules are automatically disabled during the cmake stage.

Compatibility
===========================================

Python
----------------------------------------------

Python has :ysrc:`native support <lib/high-precision/ToFromPythonConverter.hpp>` for high precision types using ``mpmath`` package. Old yade scripts that use :ref:`supported modules <supportedModules>` can be immediately converted to high precision by switching to high precision version of minieigen. In order to do so, the following line:

.. code-block:: python

	from minieigen import *

has to be replaced with:

.. code-block:: python

	from yade.minieigenHP import *

Respectively ``import minieigen`` has to be replaced with ``import yade.minieigenHP as minieigen``. The :yref:`minieigenHP module<yade.minieigenHP>` has only these four lines inside:

.. code-block:: python

	if(yade.config.highPrecisionBits != 64):
		from yade._minieigenHP import *
	else:
		from minieigen import *

So that high precision (binary compatibile) version of minieigen is used when non ``double`` types is used as ``Real``.


C++
----------------------------------------------

Mathematical functions of all high precision types are wrapped using file :ysrc:`MathFunctions.hpp <lib/high-precision/MathFunctions.hpp>`, these are the inline redirections to respective functions of the type that yade is currently being compiled with. If new mathematical function is needed it has to be added in the following places:


1. :ysrc:`lib/high-precision/MathFunctions.hpp`
2. :ysrc:`py/high-precision/_math.cpp`, see :yref:`math module<yade.math>` for details.
3. :ysrc:`py/tests/testMath.py`
4. :ysrc:`py/tests/testMathHelper.py`

The tests for a new function are to be added in :ysrc:`py/tests/testMath.py` in one of these functions: ``def oneArgMathCheck(self,r):``, ``def twoArgMathCheck(self,r1,r2):``, ``def threeArgMathCheck(self,r1,r2,r3):``. A table of expected errors in ``self.defaultTolerances`` is to be supplemented as well.


Eigen compatibility with high precision types
----------------------------------------------

Eigen library has native support 

CGAL compatibility with high precision types
----------------------------------------------


.. _vtkRealCompatibility:

VTK compatibility with high precision types
-------------------------------------------

Since VTK is only used to record results for later viewing in other software, such as `paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`__, the recording all decimal places does not seem to be necessary.
Hence all recording commands in ``C++`` convert ``Real`` type down to ``double`` using ``static_cast<double>`` command. This has been implemented via a set of macros in :ysrc:`VTKCompatibility.hpp <lib/compatibility/VTKCompatibility.hpp>` and :ysrc:`DoubleCompatibility.hpp <lib/compatibility/DoubleCompatibility.hpp>` files.

Debugging
===========================================

High precision is still in the experimental stages of implementation. Some errors may occur during use. Not all of these errors are caught by the checks and tests. An important example is `trying to use const references to Vector3r members <https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/-/merge_requests/406>`__ - a type of problem with results in a segmentation fault during runtime. The most flexibility in debugging is with ``long double`` type, because a special file :ysrc:`lib/high-precision/ThinRealWrapper.hpp` was written for that. A couple of ``#defines`` were introduced there to help debugging more difficult problems:

1. ``YADE_IGNORE_IEEE_INFINITY_NAN`` - it can be used to detect all occurrences when ``NaN`` or ``Inf`` are used. Also it is recommended to use this define when compiling yade with ``-Ofast`` flag, without  ``-fno-associative-math -fno-finite-math-only -fsigned-zeros``
2. ``YADE_WRAPPER_THROW_ON_NAN_INF_REAL`` or ``YADE_WRAPPER_THROW_ON_NAN_INF_COMPLEX`` in :ysrc:`lib/high-precision/ThinComplexWrapper.hpp` - can be useful for debugging when calculations go all wrong for unknown reason.

Also refer to :ref:`address sanitizer section <addressSanitizer>`, as it is most useful for debugging in many cases.
