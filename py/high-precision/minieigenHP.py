"""
When yade uses high-precision number as Real type the usual (old) ``import minieigen``
has to be replaced with a minieigenHP library which uses exacly the same number of decimal places
as yade is using everywhere else. Please note that such precision can be very arbitrary, because ``cpp_bin_float``
or mpfr take it as a compile-time argument. Hence such minieigenHP cannot be separately precompiled as a package.
Though it could be precompiled for some special types such as ``boost::multiprecision::float128``.
