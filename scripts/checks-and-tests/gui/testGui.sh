# testGui.py script is only a slightly modified simple-scene-energy-tracking.py example.
# the screenshots have to be taken inside yade session, while the GUI windows are open.

# You can test locally using this script, just change YADE_EXECUTABLE into something that works for you:
#YADE_EXECUTABLE=./examples/yade
#
# Also remember that default path for GuiTest files is scripts/checks-and-tests/gui/* so it to something that works for you e.g. GUI_TESTS_PATH=./
# Currently GUI_TESTS_PATH is read as an argument after calling the function
#
# then launch this command:
#   xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1600x1200x16" scripts/checks-and-tests/gui/testGui.sh
#
# or just this command:
#   scripts/checks-and-tests/gui/testGui.sh
