This mask is used to avoid the interactions inside a group of particles. To do so, the particles must have the exact same mask and that mask should have one bit in common with this :yref:`avoidSelfInteractionMask<Collider.avoidSelfInteractionMask>` as for their binary representations. The `bitwise operator <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_arithmetic#Bitwise_logic>`_ & (and), and bitwise operator | (or) are used here.

In an example with 3 mask values assigned to particles: ``0b10`` = "blue" = 2, ``0b01`` = "green" = 1, ``0b11`` = "red" = 3, and a with collider.avoidSelfInteractionMask = ``0b01`` = 1:

* Green particles would not interact with blue particles because they are not mask-compatible (do not share any "1" bit in common): ``0b01 & 0b10`` is false
* Green particles would not interact with other green particles because of avoidSelfInteractionMask: ``0b01 & 0b01`` is true
* Red particles would not interact with themselves either: ``0b11 & 0b01`` is true
* For the same reason blue particles would interact with themselves because for them avoidSelfInteractionMask: ``0b10 and 0b01`` is false
