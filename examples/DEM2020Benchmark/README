1/ The scripts in this folder were prepared as part of a benchmark exercise inspired by discussions at DEM8 Conference.

2/ They need to be ran with yade version release 01/2021 or later (version yadedaily on debian/ubuntu)
    $ apt update
    $ apt install yadedaily
    $ path/to//runAll.sh
    
3/ Please find inspiration for command line execution in 'runAll.sh' and in preamble of the example scripts

4/ Execution time ranges from ~1h to couple days depending on the script and the number of threads. You can track
 progress by checking the generated *.png files, they are updated continuously.
 
5/ Alternatively, run with graphical interface (needs X server available) and inspet the 3D view (close it when done to not add overhead)
