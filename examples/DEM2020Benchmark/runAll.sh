# This script will download and run all cases from the 2020 benchmark. It is standalone and should run on every linux system with yade installed.
# The script itself can retrieved here:
#   $ wget https://gitlab.com/yade-dev/trunk/-/raw/fae891db7/examples/DEM2020Benchmark/runAll.sh

# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. an internet connexion (else please comment out the download part and provide the scripts in current path)
# 2. a recent version of yade (not earlier than 01/2021 else one python helper for importing mesh files would be missing)
# installation from deb packages ('focal' is ubuntu20.04, replace with relevant name of your ubuntu/debian distro [1]):
#  
#     sudo bash -c 'echo "deb http://www.yade-dem.org/packages/ focal main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
#     wget -O - http://www.yade-dem.org/packages/yadedev_pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
#     sudo apt-get update
#     sudo apt-get install yadedaily
#
#  [1] if needed, more install instructions here: https://yade-dem.org/doc/installation.html


# OUTPUTS:
# *.png and *.txt files per-job will be in ./outputData
# synthetic png per case will be in current path, as well as a summary of the timings in timings.txt

# WARNING
# If for some reason this script execution is stopped with 'ctrl+z' before the end, then some jobs will stay behind and still use ressources, 
# don't forget 'pkill -9 yadedaily' after that (or whatever yade version it is) to really kill them


# That url should point to valid gitlab branch from where the benchmark scripts can be retrieved
