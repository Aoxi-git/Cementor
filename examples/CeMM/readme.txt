1. phase1_generateHostSample.py is for generating a host sample with a target porosity and void ratio. The host sample is saved after the execution of phase1_generateHostSample.py.

2. phase2_addFinesInTargetMicrostructure.py is for generating fines with a specifical distribution pattern in the given host sample. The host sample generated from phase1_generateHostSample.py is imported. Therefore, phase2_addFinesInTargetMicrostructure.py should be executed after phase1_generateHostSample.py.
